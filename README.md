# Cyber Engineering Research - Design World Case Study

## Overview

Design World (DW) is a multinational engineering and design firm formed from the merger of three smaller firms. The company specializes in artistic structural support systems. DW faced security challenges, including physical break-ins and hacking incidents resulting in the theft of valuable intellectual property (IP). To address these issues, DW implemented a private enterprise cloud solution with the assistance of the Cyber Cloud.

## Synopsis

In this course, students formed project teams to establish an international structural design private cloud for Design World. The project aimed to enhance security and comply with NIST SP800-171R2 regulations.

## Deliverable Materials

### Preliminary Findings
- System and Security Requirements Document
- Vulnerability Assessment Plan
- Vulnerability Assessment Report
- Penetration Test Plan
- Penetration Test Report
- Project Change Request (PCR) for design changes and Security Hardening Plan
- Updated system design with updated drawings (as Required)

### Post hardening
- Vulnerability Assessment Report (Post Hardening)
- Penetration Test Report (Post Hardening)
- DW Information System Security Plan (with DW Security Policies)
- Project Report
- Project PowerPoint presentation

## Project Scope

The project aims to secure the international structural design private cloud of Design World. The team will conduct a comprehensive security engineering review, vulnerability assessment, and penetration test to ensure the system's resilience against cyber threats. The project will adhere to assumptions, including a private cloud operated by a US company, virtual Intel-based systems, VPN access control, and remote work environments.
