# Cyber Engineering Research - Design World Case Study

## Overview
Design World (DW) is a multinational engineering and design firm formed from the merger of three smaller firms. The company specializes in artistic structural support systems. DW faced security challenges, including physical break-ins and hacking incidents resulting in the theft of valuable intellectual property (IP). To address these issues, DW implemented a private enterprise cloud solution with the assistance of the Cyber Cloud.

In this case study, teams were formed to establish an international structural design private cloud for Design World. The project aimed to enhance security and comply with NIST SP800-171R2 regulations.

The project aims to secure the international structural design private cloud of Design World. The team will conduct a comprehensive security engineering review, vulnerability assessment, and penetration test to ensure the system's resilience against cyber threats. The project will adhere to assumptions, including a private cloud operated by a US company, virtual Intel-based systems, VPN access control, and remote work environments.
